A CSS linter that checks for the following errors

- Checks for trailing semi-colon after setting a CSS property.
- Checks for missing end-of-source newline.
- Checks if double indentation is followed by a valid CSS rule.
- Checks for newline and no leading or trailing spaces surrounding closing curly bracket.
- Checks for newline after single line declaration.
- Checks if single line declaration has only 1 declaration.
- Checks for too many spaces at end or at start.

## Good vs. Bad Code Examples

### <ins>Trailing semi-colon after setting a CSS property</ins>

\# Good example

There's a semi-colon after the css property is set.
```css
.container {
  color: blue; 
}
```

\# Bad example

Missing semi-colon.
```css
.container {
  color: blue 
}
```

### <ins>Missing EOS newline</ins>

\# Good example

```css
section {
  color: blue; 
} 
/* file ends here with final empty line */
```

\# Bad example

```css
section {
  color: blue; 
} /* file ends here without final empty line */
```

### <ins>Closing Brackets should be on their own</ins>

\# Good example

The closing bracket has no leading or trailing spaces.

```css
div {
  font-size: 12px; # double indent 
}
```

\# Bad example

The closing bracket has leading and trailing spaces.

```css
section {
  color: blue; 
   }   
```

### <ins>Missing newline after single line declaration</ins>

\# Good example

The closing bracket no leading spaces.

```css
div { font-size: 12px; }

.new-rule {
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 11px;
}
```

\# Bad example

The closing bracket has empty spaces after the closing bracket.

```css
div { font-size: 12px; }   |

.new-rule {
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 11px;
}
```

### <ins>Too many spaces at start or end</ins>

\# Good example

Maximum of 2 spaces at start of line.

```css
div { font-size: 12px; }

.new-rule {
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 11px;
}
```

\# Bad examples

The code has too many spaces at the start of the lines.

```css
  div { font-size: 12px; }   

.new-rule {
    color: #fff;
  font-size: 11px;
}
```

4. Run `cd ruby-capstone-linter` to go to the project folder.
5. Drag the css file(s) you would like the linter to inspect into the projects folder, the linter will scan and check all files ending with `.css`.
6. Run `bin/main.rb` to start the linter and the flaws in your code will be revealed.
7. (Optional) If you don't want the linter to ignore specific files run `bin/main.rb ignore <filename.css>`. If you would like more than 1 file to be ignored add more filenames (separated by spaces) to the end of the command.
